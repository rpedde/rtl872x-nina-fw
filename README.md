# rtl872x-nina-fw #

This is probaby an ill-fated attempt to make a minimal workalike
of the arduino esp32 nina firmware for the rtl8720dn.

My proximate goal is to get reasonable networking on circuitpython
running on the wio terminal.

This almost certainly doesn't actually work yet, unless you are
reading this in the far distant future.  Even then, it probably
never came to fruition.  Sorry 'bout that.
